# üìö Library Inventory Management Web App

## üìù Project Overview

Welcome to **Library Inventory Management Web App**, a fullstack, end-to-end Maven web application developed in Java. The project employs traditional Spring and Hibernate for the backend, while the frontend is crafted using Thymeleaf, HTML, and CSS with Bootstrap. This application allows you to manage an inventory of books, including viewing a list, and managing individual books (add, edit, delete). It also exposes a RESTful API for CRUD operations on the library inventory through the `/api/` endpoint. The application is deployed in Docker.

This project showcases a comprehensive approach to handling book inventories with modern web technologies and containerization.

- **Hibernate**: ORM framework for database interaction.
- **MySQL**: Relational database used to store book inventory data.
- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the web content.
- **CSS**: Stylesheet language for designing the application.
- **Thymeleaf**: Server-side template engine for rendering views.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: IDE used for development.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for deploying the application.
